File Utilities library for AutoItV3.

FileLib version 1.0.2.2
Released under GPLv2

NOTE: _FileCopyDlg, FileMoveDlg, _FileDeleteDlg, and _FileRenameDlg appear to have bugs on Win7 and later.
I have not yet addressed this, but I assume it has something to do with the underlying API calls into shell32.dll.
I will fix this in a later release. It still works fine in previous versions of Windows.
