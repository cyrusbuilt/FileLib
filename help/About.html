<H1>Synopsis</H1>
		CyrusBuilt File Utilities Library for AutoIt V3 was created to "scratch an itch".  This library
		is essentially a collection of functions I initially wrote in other scripts due to the lack of a
		similar function (or a similar function existed but didn't operate the same way) being built into
		AutoItV3.  Since I started using these functions frequently in other projects, it was decided to
		build a seperate library so that I could just include it in future projects.
		<br>
		<br>
		The purpose of this library is to provide certain file/disk facilities that don't currently exist
		in AutoIt such as disk-existence checking or recursive path listing.<br>
		<br>
		<p>Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Get library version</li>
			<li>Get File/Folder extension</li>
			<li>File Comparison</li>
			<li>Disk (drive letter) existence checking</li>
			<li>Get info about a drive (returns an array)</li>
			<li>Check to see if a drive letter is a network drive</li>
			<li>Test to see if a path is a directory</li>
			<li>Recursive full-path listing of a specified directory</li>
			<li>Get a file name from a path</li>
			<li>File/Directory copy with progress dialog</li>
			<li>Move File(s)/Directory with progress dialog</li>
			<li>Delete File(s)/Directory with progress dialog</li>
			<li>Rename a file or directory with progress dialog</li>
			<li>Check if a directory is empty</li>
			<li>Get the directory of a specified file path</li>
			<li>Truncate a file name to DOS style 8.3 format.</li>
		</ul>
